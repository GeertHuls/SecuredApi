# SecuredApi

This is a proof of concept in order to implement OAuth2's implicit grant flow within a spa js app using IdentityServer3.

*JS libs*

Use bower to resolve all (client side) js libraries.

*It works on my machine*

The app will run out of the box using the following setup:
IdentityServer: https://secured.local:449/identityserver
SpaClient: https://secured.local:449/spaclient
ResourceServer: https://secured.local:449/resourceserver

Otherwise choose whatever hosts you like.
